"""check_stale.py - fail loudly if any chain has not COMPLETED a scrape for days.

The alert job only fires when a job fails, so a chain that quietly stops
finishing (site blocking us, sitemap changed, a bug that never reaches the
completion marker) never trips anything: the weeks-long "completion marker
never written" bug went unnoticed for exactly this reason. Each chain's
data/latest/.<chain>-complete holds the date of its last full pass; this
exits 1 (-> continue-check job fails -> the alert job opens an issue) when
any is older than MAX_AGE_DAYS or missing.

Country-agnostic: the chain list is auto-discovered from data/latest
(per-chain *.jsonl files), so the same script works in every *-priser repo.
A CHAINS env var (comma/space separated) overrides discovery if set.

KNOWN_BLOCKED lists chains verified permanently bot-walled from datacenter IPs
(no marker AND no checkpoint will ever exist for them). They stay in CHAINS so
each nightly cron still retries for free, but they must not fire a red alert
every night - a wall we already diagnosed is not a new bug. Verified live:
k_rauta.fi 403s its sitemap from GitHub runners while serving residential IPs
(2026-09-30..10-03).
